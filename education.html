								<p>I have completed my undergraduate and MSci degree in Theoretical Physics at University College London. I graduated in 2020 and was awarded First Class Honours, and have achieved over 80% grade average throughout all modules. <br> During my degree I gained expertise in numerous areas of mathematics, such as logic, calculus, algebra,  linear algebra and statistics. The mathematical skills enabled me to learn about awesome fields in physics, from thermodynamics to electromagnetism, through cosmology, chaos theory and advanced topics in quantummechanics.</p>
								<p>I have been interested in programming since primary school, where I competed in national competitions using Logo. Then as the first Android phones appeared, I was fascinated and picked up Java from online courses to be able to build simple games and applets. This fascination with coding and technology pushed me to pick as many computational modules through my degree as possible, while still learning the problem solving and critical thinking skills necessary for excellence in my Physics courses. I have taken modules in scientific computing, HPC, machine learning, and quantum computing, and completed projects involving modelling and microcontroller programming. Furthermore, in my MSc research project I worked on creating a cutting edge, extensive C++ simulation of quantummechanical effects in light-matter interactions. </p>
